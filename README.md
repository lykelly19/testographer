# Testographer  


## How to Run Prototype  
In order to run the prototype, Unity must be installed on the machine (https://store.unity.com/). Unity version 2021.2.1f1 must also be installed.  

The downloads for the game can be found on the GitHub repository for the Testographer project (https://github.com/lykelly19/testographer). After downloading the project scenes and scripts, Unity can be used to run the prototype.  

In Unity Hub, click on the "Add" button. Click on the folder that contains the downloaded files. Unity 2D should open automatically with the folder and program contents.   

The prototype can be run by creating and running a build.   

To create and run a build, click on File > Build and Run. Select an empty folder to store the files. Name the file “testographer” and click on the Save button. Navigate to the folder in your computer’s file explorer application. Open the file called “testographer”; the game will load and run.
